# Soti_Dynamic_Template
A Soti MobiControl template, that's dynamic.  A mobile phone style template that changes automatically depending on how many entries you have in your lock screen.  It keeps you from having to change the HTML every time you want to change the lock screen entries.  It's  dynamic for screen size and changes based on device orientation.  If the "package name" field is set to [HIDDEN] then it will not show up on the lockscreen but still be whitelisted.  It also has a feature that lets you change the Header and the Footer by simply creating a Lock Screen policy with the "package name" field set to [HTML HEADER or HTML-HEADER], or [HTML FOOTER or HTML-FOOTER].  Text can be entered into the "Display Name" field or a graphic can be used if it is selected in the Image pull-down.  This template uses CSS and Javascript.

Please Fork if you change the design but use the dynamic part of the code.
